    "- There are two separate LSTMs in this model (see diagram on the left). Because the one at the bottom of the picture is a Bi-directional LSTM and comes *before* the attention mechanism, we will call it *pre-attention* Bi-LSTM. The LSTM at the top of the diagram comes *after* the attention mechanism, so we will call it the *post-attention* LSTM. The pre-attention Bi-LSTM goes through $T_x$ time steps; the post-attention LSTM goes through $T_y$ time steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The post-attention LSTM passes $s^{\\langle t \\rangle}, c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ from one time step to the next. In the lecture videos, we were using only a basic RNN for the post-activation sequence model, so the state captured by the RNN output activations $s^{\\langle t\\rangle}$. But since we are using an LSTM here, the LSTM has both the output activation $s^{\\langle t\\rangle}$ and the hidden cell state $c^{\\langle t\\rangle}$. However, unlike previous text generation examples (such as Dinosaurus in week 1), in this model the post-activation LSTM at time $t$ does will not take the specific generated $y^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$ as input; it only takes $s^{\\langle t\\rangle}$ and $c^{\\langle t\\rangle}$ as input. We have designed the model this way, because (unlike language generation where adjacent characters are highly correlated) there isn't as strong a dependency between the previous character and the next character in a YYYY-MM-DD date. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We use $a^{\\langle t \\rangle} = [\\overrightarrow{a}^{\\langle t \\rangle}; \\overleftarrow{a}^{\\langle t \\rangle}]$ to represent the concatenation of the activations of both the forward-direction and backward-directions of the pre-attention Bi-LSTM. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The diagram on the right uses a `RepeatVector` node to copy $s^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$'s value $T_x$ times, and then `Concatenation` to concatenate $s^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$ and $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ to compute $e^{\\langle t, t'}$, which is then passed through a softmax to compute $\\alpha^{\\langle t, t' \\rangle}$. We'll explain how to use `RepeatVector` and `Concatenation` in Keras below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets implement this model. You will start by implementing two functions: `one_step_attention()` and `model()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) `one_step_attention()`**: At step $t$, given all the hidden states of the Bi-LSTM ($[a^{<1>},a^{<2>}, ..., a^{<T_x>}]$) and the previous hidden state of the second LSTM ($s^{<t-1>}$), `one_step_attention()` will compute the attention weights ($[\\alpha^{<t,1>},\\alpha^{<t,2>}, ..., \\alpha^{<t,T_x>}]$) and output the context vector (see Figure  1 (right) for details):\n",
    "$$context^{<t>} = \\sum_{t' = 0}^{T_x} \\alpha^{<t,t'>}a^{<t'>}\\tag{1}$$ \n",

In the lecture videos, the context was denoted $c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, but here we are calling it $context^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ to avoid confusion with the (post-attention) LSTM's internal memory cell variable, which is sometimes also denoted $c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**2) `model()`**: Implements the entire model. It first runs the input through a Bi-LSTM to get back $[a^{<1>},a^{<2>}, ..., a^{<T_x>}]$. Then, it calls `one_step_attention()` $T_y$ times (`for` loop). At each iteration of this loop, it gives the computed context vector $c^{<t>}$ to the second LSTM, and runs the output of the LSTM through a dense layer with softmax activation to generate a prediction $\\hat{y}^{<t>}$. \n",

The function `model()` will call the layers in `one_step_attention()` $T_y$ using a for-loop, and it is important that all $T_y$ copies have the same weights. I.e., it should not re-initiaiize the weights every time. In other words, all $T_y$ steps should have shared weights. Here's how you can implement layers with shareable weights in Keras:\n",
